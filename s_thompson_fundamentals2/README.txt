Week 2 Application: Fundamentals

GitHub: https://github.com/n38803/MDF3_2

Special Instructions:

1. Fixed issue with PendingIntent forcing pause in application.
2. Application has 2 distinctly different UIs when in portrait vs landscape orientation.  Persisting service leak force closes the application. My video shows both orientations working, just canâ€™t seem to figure out how to safely unbind and save instance of the activity.
